Rock paper scissors game where you play against the computer.

What I learned

-Deepened knowledge of how functions work with each other.

-The concept of global and local scope for variables was internalized.

-Took 10 hours to finish this project.

-Hit a lot of walls, but was able to punch through them using the 'take a break' technique. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by a problem, take a break and come back later.
