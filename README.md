# Rock Paper Scissors 

The goal of this project was to create a simple implementation of rock-paper-scissors in the browser console. It is an updated version of previous code which did not include a UI.

Steps:

1. Copy your original code into a new file so you donâ€™t lose it. 
2. For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds. 
3. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
3. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods. 
4. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points. 
5. You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. Thatâ€™s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmerâ€™s life. 
6. Donâ€™t forget to go back and add your new version to the original Rock Paper Scissors Project! 

Skills strengthened/demonstrated: -DOM manipulation, including the use of querySelector(), createElement(), modifying text content, and appending/removing child nodes. -the use of event listeners to trigger blocks of code -learning the importance of separating re-used blocks of code into functions, instead of having the same lines of code repeated.
